Installation
************

For now, the best way to install stglib is to have an environment set up with Anaconda. Within your environment, ``cd`` to the directory containing stglib, and type the following:

``pip install -e . --no-deps``

This will not install dependencies that stglib relies on, but these are better managed through Anaconda anyway. If you get errors about missing packages, install them using ``conda install``.
