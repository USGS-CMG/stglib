zeroed_pressure: 'Yes' # was pressure zeroed before deployment
trim_method: 'water level sl'  # Water Level SL trims bin if any part of bin or side lobe is out of water - works best when pressure is corrected for atmospheric
# trim_method: 'bin range'
# good_bins: [0,7] # with these two options, trim to the first 7 bins from the transducer
